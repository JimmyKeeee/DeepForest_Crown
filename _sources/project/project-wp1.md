Deep learning for intelligent placement of environmental sensors
=======================

We use Deep Learning to extract large-scale spatio-temporal information, combining information from global satellite and climate simulators, to make probabilistic predictions at the local-scale (including Urban environments) over various time horizons (seasonal to decadal). 

The key aim here is to develop maps of uncertainty to identify where more surface sensors are needed (and where AI has sufficient skill making it feasible to reduce measurement sampling and conserve energy).
