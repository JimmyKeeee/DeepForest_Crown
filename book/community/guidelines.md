This section covers guidelines related to effective and inclusive collaboration. In general, The Environmental AI community consists of four defined roles: maintainers, contributors, reviewers and users. Inspired by [the Turing Way Guide for Collaboration](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/collaboration/maintain-review/maintain-review-maintenance.html), we provide below descriptions of these community roles:

* Maintainers: to provide support with keeping the existing code updated by keeping track of new contributions.
* Contributors: to create/design content  
* Reviewer: to review content
* Reader/User: to read/share content, occasionally raise errors such as typos and bugs and fix them.
