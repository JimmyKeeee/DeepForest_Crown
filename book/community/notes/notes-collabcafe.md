# Notes from the last call: 

## Archive: 28 September - Data preprocessing

**Name + What‚Äôs the hardest part about working virtually for you? and the easiest? + an emoji to represent it ([emoji cheatsheet](https://github.com/ikatyang/emoji-cheat-sheet/blob/master/README.md))**

* Alejandro + social interaction, more sleep time + :busts_in_silhouette:	 :sleeping: 
* Sam A. + I still have just as many meetings if not more and it is soooo tiring! :sleeping: :pleading_face:
* Evangeline + Feeling self-conscious on camera, flexibility + :movie_camera: :clock1: 

### Conversation Starters

*Advertise and promote your event or anything exciting you're working on.* ‚ú®

* Met Office / Joint centre for excellence in environmental intelligence conference 16/17 Dec 2021!
* We have a fresh interactive notebook in the Environmental AI Book :earth_asia::books: The notebook focuses on detecting tree crowns using the *DeepForest* model :deciduous_tree:. Have a look at the rendered version [here](https://acocac.github.io/environmental-ai-book/forest/modelling/forest-modelling-treecrown_deepforest.html). Other recent community contributions are the exploration of sensor data, [Met Office UKV high-resolution atmosphere model data for urban settings](https://acocac.github.io/environmental-ai-book/urban/sensors/urban-sensors-ukv.html) and [MODIS satellite imagery and wildfire data](https://acocac.github.io/environmental-ai-book/wildfires/sensors/wildfires-sensors-modis.html).

### Breakout rooms: Topic proposals
*Topics for breakout / Names*

* Sam A. Manufacture Urban Data in GIS format
* Evie. Preprocessing satellite data for crop yield prediction
* Alejandro. Preprocess FluxNet data and related gridded products

### Notes and questions

* We showcased the [SEPAL platform](https://docs.sepal.io/en/latest/cookbook/area_estimation.html) for Vegetation Satellite Image analysis. 
* Discussed challenges around scoping and extracting satellite data for machine learning models of vegetation (agricultural crops):
    * Appropriate satellite platform (Sentinel/LANDSAT?)
    * Preprocessing of radar and optical data (i.e. dealing with cloud cover)
    * Appropriate time series/critical dates for plant growth
* Sam A. used ArcGIS pro to extract site-specific temperature information from a gridded netCDF dataset using the Spatial Analyst 'Sample' tool. It is very useful in that it works across the time dimension so I could do this for 1 year of data in one go. It is also possible to set a desired output coordinate system. I could save the data out as a csv file and then use standard python tools like pandas and numpy for further processing  
* Sam A suggests using [Iris package](https://scitools-iris.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for reprojecting gridded netCDF files. The project is
* Data preprocessing is still too time-consuming, and there is lack of communication of the tools available. 

### Request for reviews!

* None

### Feedback at the end of the call

* None

## Archive: 29 June - Data Visualization

### Conversation Starters

*Advertise and promote your event or anything exciting you're working on.* ‚ú®

* Alejandro: EGU Public call-for-session-proposals all other sessions: Deadline: [6 September 2021](https://www.egu22.eu/)
* Scott: Pangeo European Community is growing and there are plans of coffee chats and regular showcase meetings (see [here](https://cnrs.zoom.us/j/95432814658))

### Breakout rooms: Topic proposals

*Topics for breakout / Names*

* Sam J: Regridding MODIS data for wildfires detection
* Tom: Produce script to reproduce IceNet paper figures for *Nature Communications*
* Emily: Visualization of LiDAR data
* Scott: Organizing and Admin EnvSensors WPs project timetable
* Alejandro: Deploying a FluxNet use case visualization outputs for the Environmental AI book

### Notes and questions

* Emily showed a cool visualization of a laser scan image (100 GB) using the propietary software of the scanner device. After data preprocessing, she will use  libraries for visualizing individual trees. 
    * Emily says there are also some radar sensors that collect soil data. 
* Tools for regridding MODIS data. Sam is using [*satpy*](https://satpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/overview.html). Suggestions of other existing tools are welcome. 
* Tom is making his code nicer i.e. modules and efficient i.e using dask. 
* Alejandro shows FluxNet demo
    * Emily suggest adding woodlands and shrubs to subset FluxNet data. 

### Feedback at the end of the call
* Add a disclaimer collaboration cafes' hackMDs are public.
* Names for breakout rooms.
* We should aim to keep to time, once we are used to the format etc.
