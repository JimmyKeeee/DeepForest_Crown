We're still defining and assessing formats to engage the Environmental Data Science community.

Inspired by [_The Turing Way_ collaboration cafe template](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/blob/master/book/website/community-handbook/templates/template-coworking-collabcafe.md), we have successfully conducted 4 monthly collaborations cafes (see [here](https://hackmd.io/@environmental-ds/collaboration-cafe]) the shared notes). 

Other potential spaces to keep activity within the Environmental Data Science community are:
* Show and tell: common within the software development community, it's **a showcasing space** to **celebrate** and **get feedback** of what you or your team has accomplished related to environmental data science.
* Journal clubs: common within the research community, it's **a discussion space** that engage anyone interested in **critically evaluating** recent articles in the **academic literature** around a defined subject in basic or applied research, in this case conceptual or experimental AI and data science for environmental studies.
