# Digital Twins

@article{Niederer2021,
abstract = {Mathematical modeling and simulation are moving from being powerful development and analysis tools towards having increased roles in operational monitoring, control and decision support, in which models of specific entities are continually updated in the form of a digital twin. However, current digital twins are largely the result of bespoke technical solutions that are difficult to scale. We discuss two exemplar applications that motivate challenges and opportunities for scaling digital twins, and that underscore potential barriers to wider adoption of this technology. Development in digital-twin technology has been rapidly growing across a range of industries and disciplines. However, to ensure a wider and more robust adoption of such technology, various challenges must be addressed by the computational science community.},

abstract={A unifying mathematical formulation is needed to move from one-off digital twins built through custom implementations to robust digital twin implementations at scale. This work proposes a probabilistic graphical model as a formal mathematical representation of a digital twin and its associated physical asset. We create an abstraction of the asset--twin system as a set of coupled dynamical systems, evolving over time through their respective state spaces and interacting via observed data and control inputs. The formal definition of this coupled system as a probabilistic graphical model enables us to draw upon well-established theory and methods from Bayesian statistics, dynamical systems and control theory. The declarative and general nature of the proposed digital twin model make it rigorous yet flexible, enabling its application at scale in a diverse range of application areas. We demonstrate how the model is instantiated to enable a structural digital twin of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). The digital twin is calibrated using experimental data from a physical UAV asset. Its use in dynamic decision-making is then illustrated in a synthetic example where the UAV undergoes an in-flight damage event and the digital twin is dynamically updated using sensor data. The graphical model foundation ensures that the digital twin calibration and updating process is principled, unified and able to scale to an entire fleet of digital twins.},
