Detecting and tracking environmental change from remote sensors
=======================

Develop generic and accessible computer vision tools for detecting and tracking dynamic objects in noisy and imperfect imagery. The primary case study here will be detecting and then tracking icebergs, where the prediction of trajectories may be improved by combining satellite imagery/photos (from drones, ships) with ocean circulation data (from surface sensors or simulations). We will also explore and further develop these tools to detect and track changes over other environments (e.g., forests).
